# My Web Server

This project sets up a basic web server using Node.js. It serves as an entry point for handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-web-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-web-server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. You can modify the request handling in `src/server.js` to suit your needs.
